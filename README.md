# Incident-Detection-System-using-YOLOv8

🔍 Excited to share my latest project: An Advanced Incident Detection System!
I've developed a comprehensive security monitoring application that uses computer vision and AI to detect various security incidents in real-time, including falls, intrusions, loitering, and abandoned objects.
In this screen recording, you can see the system in action with these key features:

🎥 Real-time camera feed analysis using YOLOv8 pose detection
📊 Interactive visualizations including heatmaps and 3D spatial analysis
📱 Customizable alerting system with notifications
📋 Detailed incident logging and analytics dashboard
🔧 Custom detection rules and zone configuration

This application integrates PyQt6 for the UI, OpenCV for video processing, YOLO for object detection, and matplotlib for advanced visualizations. Perfect for security monitoring in various environments including healthcare facilities, public spaces, and commercial buildings.
Looking to collaborate on similar projects or discuss how this technology can be applied in different security contexts? Let's connect!
